Revision history for ExtUtils-Install

1.35  Wed Feb  1 23:00:00 CST 2006

 - First independent release; Extracted ExtUtils::Install,
   ExtUtils::Installed, & ExtUtils::Packlist from MakeMaker.

 - Changed the $VERSION of all modules to the same version number, a
   number higher than all $VERSIONs.

1.36 2006-03-11 12:42

- Extended Win32 support. Added ExtUtils::Install::MUST_REBOOT to
handle such scenario when rebooting.

- Released as ex-ExtUtils-Install by demerphq

1.37 2006-03-12 23:20

- Refactored reboot support. Integrated changes from Randy Sims
in p5p message 4413F4E9.7090802@thepierianspring.org

1.3701 2006-03-13 20:00

- Integrated patch from Randy Sims.

    1. Fixes error during `perl Makefile.PL` because it MakeMaker can't
    find the NAME section describing DISTNAME (which has the 'ex-'
    prefix).

    2. Win32API::File is recommended on MSWin32 && cygwin.

    3. Under Perl5.005, ExtUtils::MM is not present in the version of
    MakeMaker included. I don't know what version first includes it.
    Needs research or better: eliminate need for it.

    4. Test::More is bundled with the distro for its test suite. This
    would be needed on Perl5.005, for example. It was listed as a
    requirement, but the directory it's bundled in is not in @INC when
    prereqs are checked. I removed the prereq from Build.PL &
    Makefile.PL. Other options: 1) fixup @INC to include t/lib; or 2)
    unbundle and add back to prereqs.

    4. Update t/pod.t t/pod-coverage fixup of @INC so it can find
    bundled Test::More.

- Fixed pod/coverage related issues.

- When trying to schedule a delete at reboot after renaming a dll out of
the way no error occurs if Win32API::File isn't available. Instead it
merely warns that the file should be hand deleted.

- Fixed install at reboot behaviour by making sure the temporar file is
writable after install (normally files installed are readonly)

1.3702 2006-03-19 16:54

- Added support for skipping files during install based on a set of filter
rules. If there is an INSTALL.SKIP in the current directory when doing an
install then it is loaded, otherwise if there is a MANIFEST.SKIP then it is
loaded. If neither exists then no filtration occurs.  The env variable
EU_INSTALL_IGNORE_SKIP may be set to a true value to override this behaviour.
This means that you can make .svn directories be ignored on install.

1.38 2006-04-02 17:31

- Removed MANIFEST.SKIP support (INSTALL.SKIP still supported), and
added support for providing a fallback skip file by using
ENV{EU_INSTALL_SITE_SKIP} as a fallback if there is not a distribution
specific skip file.

- Released under the ExtUtils-Install-1.38 Name
